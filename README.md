# ðŸ“Š Libraries in Numbers: Public Library Usage and Funding (FY 2022)

**Libraries in Numbers** is a public data analytics project that explores how libraries serve communities through usage trends, program offerings, digital access, and funding equity.

Using real-world data from the Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS), this project cleans and visualizes key performance indicators (KPIs) to better understand the evolving role of libraries across the U.S.
