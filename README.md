# 📊 Libraries in Numbers: Unlocking Community Impact through Data

Welcome to **Libraries in Numbers**, a public data analysis project focused on exploring the powerful impact of public libraries through open data. This project highlights how libraries support education, access to technology, and community engagement—using data to tell that story.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

To demonstrate practical data analytics skills by:
- Analyzing public library usage trends using real-world data
- Creating clear and impactful visualizations
- Building an interactive dashboard or report for stakeholders
- Showing how data can inform community-focused decision-making

## 📊 Data Source

We use public datasets from the [Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS)](https://www.imls.gov/research-evaluation/data-collection/public-libraries-survey), including:
- Total library visits
- Circulation stats (print, digital)
- Program attendance
- Internet sessions
- Library staffing, funding, and service areas

---

## 🔍 Analysis Highlights

- 📈 Trends in library visits and digital resource use
- 🌐 Internet access and tech equity across urban/rural libraries
- 👥 Program attendance vs. population served
- 🧠 Impact metrics normalized per capita
- 📍 Regional comparisons by state or service population
