IMLS 2022 PUBLIC LIBRARIES SURVEY DATA FILES -- PUBLIC-USE FILES INSTRUCTIONS

This file provides details about the FY 2022 PUBLIC LIBRARIES SURVEY public-use data files. 
Appendix A provides the SAS codes needed to recode negative values into missing. 


DESCRIPTION OF FILES
____________________

  The Public Libraries Survey data are composed of two files: 
	Public Library System Data File (Administrative Entity or AE),
  	and Public Library Outlet Data File. 
  

  1.	Public Library System Data File. This file, also known as the Administrative Entity or AE file, includes a total of 9,248 
	records. Each library’s data consist of one record. The file includes 10 records for administrative entities that were reported
	as temporarily closed for FY 2022 (STATSTRU, Structure Change Code, ‘23’). Records for public libraries that were temporarily 
	closed for the current year are included in the file for that year only. The temporarily closed records are not included in the 
	appendix tables of the data documentation.  Data for the temporarily closed records are set to a value of -3 with flag U_22 (not imputed).         


  2.	Public Library Outlet Data File includes a total of 17,546 total records. The file includes identifying information and a few 
	basic data items for public library service outlets (central, branch, bookmobile, and books-by-mail-only outlets). The data for 
	each outlet consists of one record, except where a single outlet represents multiple bookmobiles. For these outlets, a single record
	includes information for all bookmobiles and the variable L_NUM_BM indicates the number of associated bookmobiles.
	
	The file includes 96 records for outlets that were reported as temporarily closed for FY 2022 (STATSTRU, Structure 
	Change Code, ‘23’). Records for public libraries that were temporarily closed for the current year are included in the file
	for that year only. The temporarily closed records are not included in the appendix tables of the data documentation. Data for the temporarily 
	closed records are set to a value of -3 with flag U_22 (not imputed).  	


Public-Use Data Files and Programs
______________________________________

  In the public-use Public Library System Data File, selected expenditures data (i.e., Salaries, Employee Benefits, Total 
  Staff Expenditures, and Other Operating Expenditures) of public libraries have been removed (i.e., the field is set 
  to -9, with flag H_22) when the total FTE staff is less than or equal to 2.00, to protect confidentiality. 
  These data may also be suppressed for other libraries to ensure that all states that have suppressed data have a minimum of 
  three suppressed records. The library’s Total Operating Expenditures and Other Expenditures Data are not affected by the suppression 
  of these data. No data are suppressed in the public-use versions of the Public Library Outlet Data File.  
	
  Missing data are imputed on the public-use files. 

  For each file, both unimputed and imputed versions are provided, and available in three file types: CSV, SAS, and SPSS.

  For SAS users, data format programs are provided. For SPSS users, data formats are included in the data files.
